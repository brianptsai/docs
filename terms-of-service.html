<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: </strong>(a) Negotiations. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you and SGE agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, controversy or claim related to these TOS (“<b>Claim</b>”) (except those Claims expressly provided in Section 19(f) below) informally for at least thirty (30) days. Negotiations will begin upon written notice. SGE will send its notice to your billing or other physical address (if on file with SGE) and email you a copy to the email address you have provided. You will send your notice to Sleepy Giant Entertainment, Inc., <strong>303 Broadway Street Suite 104-74, Laguna Beach, California 92651</strong>, ATTN: CEO.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(b) Binding Arbitration. If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations within the above thirty (30) day period, you and SGE agree that, except as provided in Section 19(f) below, all Claims will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "<b>JAMS Rules</b>") and under the terms set forth in these Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 19and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 19 will control and prevail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Except as otherwise set forth in Section 19(f), you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, (i) you and SGE may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator's decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND SGE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(c)Arbitration Fees. If you are an individual and you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will only need to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 and we will pay all other costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim and you are an individual, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. Notwithstanding anything in the clause titled “General” below to the contrary, if you are an individual, you will not be required to pay our attorneys’ fees or other costs if you do not prevail in the arbitration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(d) Location. If you are an individual, the arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify SGE in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of SGE’s arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in the County of Orange, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or Internet connection appearances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(e)Limitations. You and SGE agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between SGE and you individually. YOU AND SGE AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(f)Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration. You and SGE agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or SGE’s intellectual property rights;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iii) any Claim for equitable relief;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(iv) any Claim in which you are a corporation, limited liability company, limited company, trust or other legal entity other than an individual person. In addition to the foregoing, in the case where you are an individual, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. As some jurisdictions do not allow for some of the dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms of Service, some of these provisions may not apply to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">(g) Severability. You and SGE agree that if any portion this “Dispute Resolution” section is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 19(f) above), that portion will be severed and the remainder of this section will be given full force and effect. If Section 19(f) above is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor SGE will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 19(f) above found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Orange, California, United States of America, and you and SGE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>22. </strong><b>EQUITABLE REMEDIES: </b> You hereby agree that SGE would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this TOS were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this TOS, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.</span></p>
